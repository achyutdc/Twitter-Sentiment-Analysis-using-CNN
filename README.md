Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks
NAAN Mudhalvan Final Project by Achyut Prasad D.C. (2021503002)
Introduction
Millions of people use Twitter to express their emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Sentiment analysis aims to detect these emotions, opinions, assessments, and attitudes expressed in text data. It classifies emotions into classes such as positive or negative. This analysis is crucial for industries to understand customer satisfaction levels and improve their services accordingly. Twitter, with about 200 million users, is one of the most prominent microblogging platforms, allowing users to share their thoughts, emotions, and messages in tweets limited to 140 characters. Sentiment analysis on Twitter data relies heavily on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stop words removal, and cleaning of text.

Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a sentiment analyzer using neural networks to identify the sentiment (positive or negative) of Twitter tweets. TensorFlow will be used for implementation.

Evaluation Measures
After training the model, the following evaluation measures will be applied:

Accuracy
Confusion matrix with plot
ROC Curve
Technical Approach
Python language and Jupyter Notebook will be used for implementation, supporting machine learning and data science projects. The model will be built using TensorFlow based on the Sentiment 140 dataset, which will be split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The model's performance will be evaluated after training.

Source of Data
The Sentiment 140 dataset can be found here.

Results
(Results will be added here upon completion of the project)
